# Best-Before-Clock

This is a fitbit clockface I developed to use at work. I work in a Supermarket and find myself regularly having to check dates on products for customer deliveries.
I created this clockface to clearly display the two things I need to know at work - date and time. Tapping the date changes the displayed date to a target best
before date (default 3 days in the future).
